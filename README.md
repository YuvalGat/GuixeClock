# Guixé Clock
This playground was inspired by the [Guixé Clock](http://www.guixe.com/products/ALESSI/Wall_Clocks.html) created by Martí Guixé.

The idea of this clock is to generate sentences: The clock's hands are arrows, and if you follow the back of the arrow to its front, you'll get a sentence (i.e. Desire is Design).

The original clock isn't very interactive: You can't change the words on the clock or the colours of it.

This playground lets you create and customise your own Guixé clock, allowing you to pick colours for the hands, background and clock itself, and change the words which appear on it.

Customising the clock is very easy: In order to change a word, simply click it to pick another word. If you want to change the colours, simply choose a colour from the right.

The generated sentence will appear below the clock itself.

- Note:
A lot of mathematics were applied on the Clock's hands in order to get them rotating properly. The formulas I used and the variable names are described in a PDF file I created using LaTeX and TikZ.
